### Running the Application 

In Terminal:
```
$ ./gradlew clean build run
```

### Running Tests

In Terminal:
```
$ ./gradlew test
```

### Review Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation is based on the following two factor:
1. Number of exclamation points
2. Length of review

The first will be applied first. The second will be taken into account if there is a tie. Any other ties that remain after that will be in the order in which they appear on the webpage. 

Evaluation logic is designed to be iterated upon to include more fine-tuned criteria.
